# Getting Started

This is a modification of [John Papa's version](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-tour-of-heroes) of 
the [Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) application. I have added additional complexity in order to fully demonstrate Angular dependency injection.

## Presentation

This example was created for the June 2018 [Angular Lunch presentation.](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Lunch/events/251077213/)

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PZU94vRacl_NgqsPe7uGb_vnhLCVcsqCuUTli4gHfrc/edit?usp=sharing) are available.
YouTube link will be forthcoming.

## Get the Code
```
git clone https://github.com/starjumper30/toh-injection-demo.git toh-inject
cd toh-inject
npm i
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Augury

Install the [Augury](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/augury/elgalmkoelokbchhkhacckoklkejnhcd?hl=en) Chrome extension so that you can view the injector tree in the Chrome Dev Tools.
